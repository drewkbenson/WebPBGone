# WebPBGone

Do you hate WebP's compatiblity issues? Well look no further. WebPBGone replaces the default double left click with "Convert to PNG". This uses the ImageMagick library to convert files from .webp (or any image format I suppose) to .png.

# Installation with the Installer

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/drewkbenson/WebPBGone/releases) page and download the most recent .msi

Note: On some machines the registry keys cannot be loaded. In this case, download WebPBGoneLite.msi and add_registers.reg and run both. The combination of these do what the full installer should do.
